Our idea is a smart parking system, provides that the sensors will let us know if the parking area is filled or empty, the program will keep the information about which car has come to the parking lot and how many times it has. We will give the 9th parking to the person who has parked 8 times in the parking.

The distribution of tasks is not certain, but the current plan is that I am going to be the part of back hand part that creates programs way to work and integrate the program and create the project model.
